    </h1>

<h2>
The best neigborhood is Mission
    </h2>
    <p>
      I love the Mission neighborhood because it's got so many good restaurants and it's really vibrant.  
    </p>
<h2>
The worst neighborhood is the Tenderloin
    </h2>
<p>
I don't like the Tenderloin because there are so many mentally ill, drug addicted and homeless people on the streets, and it reminds me of San Francisco's failure to deal with this sad problem.
