<h2> The Angry Tree </h2>

<p>
I had to make myself do all the class exercises twice, before I could understand frames and keyframes! I have a true understanding of what is involved in creating a frame-by-frame animation, and how much time is involved! I loved integrating sound with movement, combining a little frame-by-frame action with motion tweens.

In my animation, the tree is inanimate, until a boy decides to swing from its branches. The tree comes to life, and roars at the boy in protest at his audacity. The boy falls from the branches to the ground. It was really gratifying to see the characters come to life and interact with each other.
